To move the pieces in the game use arrow keys:
Left: move left

ESC to exit game
F2 to restart the game.
F5 to change music
F12 to save the screen to pcx file, just if you would
   like it for some reason. It will be saved as tetdat.pcx

This game has automatic sound/music card selection, so you do not
have to worry configuring it, if you can't hear any music or sound
it means that your sound card is not supported.
